// Just a simple runner for now since we are in JS environment and need TS transpile to run properly.
// But we can create a simple JS test wrapper if needed.
// For now, let's assume the user runs tests manually or via `npm test`.
// The file test/energy_manager_test.ts is a standalone module.

// We can add it to the main loop to run once if needed, but that's risky.
// Let's just leave it as a unit test file.
